Altered make file at CC from 'gcc' to 'CC = WAYPOINTS=cmp ../../afl-clang-fast # add the shit here'

run from src directory

tried using these but results didnt look good:
../../afl-fuzz -p -i seeds -o results ./grep
../../afl-fuzz -p -i seeds -o results ./grep 'for' text.txt


these ones seem the best so far:
../../afl-fuzz -p -i seeds -o results ./grep 'for'
../../afl-fuzz -p -i seeds -o results ./grep text.txt
